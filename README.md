# 🧭 FormPilot

### Resilient, multi-page form automation for Chrome — powered by recordings and Excel

Automate the tedious stuff on real-world, dynamic, government-grade web forms.
Record once. Feed it a spreadsheet. Let it fly across hundreds of rows and multi-page flows — with self-healing selectors that don't break the moment a site changes its DOM.

## Why FormPilot exists

Most "form filler" extensions are built for static HTML forms and die the moment they meet a real SPA — React-driven fields, AJAX-loaded steps, custom date pickers, or a multi-page "Save & Continue" flow like you'd find on a government portal.

FormPilot is built for exactly that environment:

- **Record** a real user session interacting with a form — clicks, inputs, date picker selections, page transitions.
- **Map** each field to a column in an Excel sheet.
- **Replay** the recording once per row, across as many pages and sessions as the form requires — resuming cleanly even if a tab closes mid-flow.

It's designed to survive the things that break naive automation: elements that mount late, selectors that go stale, network calls that haven't resolved yet, and third-party UI widgets (like custom date pickers) that don't behave like plain `<input>` fields.

## ✨ Core Engines

FormPilot isn't one script — it's a set of purpose-built subsystems that each own one hard problem:

| Engine                           | What it solves                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 **Selector Engine**           | 8-strategy fallback selector pipeline with Shadow DOM piercing, so a single DOM tweak on the target site doesn't break the whole flow |
| ⏱ **Smart Wait Engine**          | Waits on DOM readiness, network idle, and `MutationObserver` signals instead of hardcoded `sleep()` calls                             |
| ⚙️ **Execution Engine**          | A step-based state machine that drives the replay, one deterministic step at a time                                                   |
| 🔁 **Retry & Self-Heal System**  | Detects failed steps and retries with adjusted strategy before giving up                                                              |
| 💾 **State Manager**             | Persists execution progress so multi-page "Save & Continue" flows can pause, resume, or survive a browser restart                     |
| 📡 **Response Detection Engine** | Understands what the page did after an action — success, validation error, navigation, or silent failure                              |
| 🗓 **DatePicker Engine**         | Adapter-based registry (`RmdpAdapter`, `MuiAdapter`, `AntDAdapter`, generic fallback) for handling non-native date widgets            |
| 📝 **Logging System**            | Structured, queryable logs of every step, retry, and decision — built for debugging production runs, not just demos                   |

Each engine is isolated behind a clear interface, so adding support for a new date-picker library or a new wait condition doesn't mean touching the rest of the system.

## 🏗 Architecture

FormPilot works within Manifest V3's constraints deliberately — the service worker orchestrates and persists state, while the content script owns the actual long-running DOM automation (since MV3 service workers can be killed at any time).

```mermaid

    subgraph Popup["🖥️ Popup Dashboard (React + Zustand)"]
        UI[Recording / Execution Controls]
        XLS[Excel Import — SheetJS]
    end

    subgraph SW["⚙️ Service Worker (Orchestrator)"]
        SM[State Manager]
        MSG[Message Router]
    end

    subgraph CS["📄 Content Script (per tab)"]
        REC[Recorder]
        EXE[Execution Engine]
        SEL[Selector Engine]
        WAIT[Smart Wait Engine]
        RETRY[Retry / Self-Heal]
        RESP[Response Detection]
        DP[DatePicker Engine]
    end

    STORE[(IndexedDB + chrome.storage)]

    UI -->|start / pause / resume| MSG
    XLS -->|row data| MSG
    MSG <--> SM
    SM <--> STORE
    MSG <-->|route by tabId| CS
    EXE --> SEL
    EXE --> WAIT
    EXE --> RETRY
    EXE --> RESP
    EXE --> DP
    CS -.status updates.-> MSG
```

**Key architectural decisions:**

- **Content script owns execution, not the service worker.** MV3 service workers are ephemeral and can't reliably run long automation loops — so once a run starts, the content script drives it and reports state back.
- **No hardcoded delays.** Every wait is a condition (DOM mutation, network settle, element visibility) resolved by the Smart Wait Engine, not a `setTimeout` guess.
- **Adapter pattern for third-party widgets.** Rather than special-casing every date picker library in the execution engine, `DatePickerAdapter` implementations are registered and resolved per-field.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** — strict typing across the entire codebase
- **React + Zustand** — popup dashboard UI, domain-sliced state
- **Vite + @crxjs/vite-plugin** — MV3-aware build tooling with working HMR
- **IndexedDB** (via a custom `StorageManager`) + `chrome.storage` — recordings, run history, resumable state
- **SheetJS** — Excel (`.xlsx`) parsing for input data
- **Manifest V3** — service worker + content scripts, no persistent background page

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Google Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sachin-Rawal091/FORMPILOT.git
cd FORMPILOT
npm install
npm run dev        # starts Vite in watch mode with HMR
```

### Load into Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `dist/` folder generated by the build

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## 📋 Usage

1. **Record** — Open the FormPilot popup on the target form and start a recording. Interact with the form exactly as a normal user would, including any multi-page "Save & Continue" steps.
2. **Map fields to Excel** — Import your `.xlsx` file and map each recorded field to a spreadsheet column.
3. **Run** — Start execution. FormPilot replays the recording once per row, using the Selector, Wait, and Retry engines to handle timing and DOM variance automatically.
4. **Monitor & resume** — Track progress from the dashboard. If a run is interrupted, resume from the last confirmed step rather than starting over.

## 🗺 Roadmap

FormPilot is under active development, tracked against an internal production-readiness audit.

- [x] Core execution pipeline (Selector, Wait, Execution, Retry, State, Response, Logging engines)
- [x] DatePicker adapter architecture with pluggable registry
- [x] Multi-page "Save & Continue" resumable flows
- [x] MUI & Ant Design date-picker adapters
- [x] AES-GCM encryption at rest for stored spreadsheet data and files
- [x] Confirmation dialog for destructive spreadsheet actions

## Future Development

- [ ] Site Whitelist mode for domain-restricted execution
- [ ] Dashboard UI/UX refresh
